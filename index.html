                Shutterstock was founded in 2003 by American entrepreneur and computer programmer Jon Oringer. Creating
                his own online marketplace, Oringer initially uploaded 30,000 of his own stock photos and made them
                available via subscription, with unlimited downloads and a monthly starting fee of US$49. When demand
                exceeded his photo supply, he began hiring additional contributors. In 2006, the firm claimed that
                it was the "largest subscription-based stock photo agency in the world" with 570,000 images in its
                collection. The firm branched into film in 2006 with the launch of Shutterstock Footage. By 2007,
                the company had 1.8 million photos. Insight Venture Partners invested in the company that year.
                Shutterstock expanded beyond subscriptions into a la carte pricing in August 2008, with its "On Demand"
                service removing daily download limits.
